This entire Git is to include all coursework from the class.  It is being
placed on Github to afford myself easy access to it at a later date.  Each
assignment is only about one answer (or program) per Chapter section.  And
there are alot more.  These are my sollutions for the class, based on what
Mr. Stoykov was specifically asking for at the time.
