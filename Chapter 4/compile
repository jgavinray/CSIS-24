# Script for compile/running of Java applications under *nix environment
# J. Gavin Ray for CSIS-24 Fall Semester 2012
#
# This script will take a filename minus the extention and run the following
# commands.  In order for this script to be used, it must be set as an executable
# on your machine.  On the commandline, be in the same directory as the this file
# and type chmod +x compile.  Doing so will allow this file to be run by typing
# "compile (filename goes here)" or depending on your shell at the commandline
# "./compile (filenamegoes here)".

# Example:
#
# ./compile helloWorld
#

 
javac $1.java
java $1
